The reception desk for non-emergency patients is managed by $n_R$ associates. Admission at the reception (not counting any queueing time) takes 5 minutes on average, regardless of whether the non-emergency patient is first-time or returning. The clinic is served by $d_C$ doctors with an average visit time of 15 minutes. About one in every four patients visiting the clinic are asked to return for a follow-up appointment that is, on average, 3 weeks (504 hours) later in time; another one-tenth of visitors to the clinic are referred to the internal ward (IW); the rest are treated and discharged. Patients arriving to the ER require about 1 hour of time with a doctor. The ER is staffed by $d_E$ doctors. Half of the patients in the ER are discharged after treatment, with the remainder referred to the IW. The average stay in the IW is about 72 hours and there are $n_I$ IW beds available. After a stay at the IW, 20\\% of patients are discharged, whereas the rest are asked to return for a follow-up appointment as a non-emergency patient that is, on average, 3 weeks (504 hours) later in time. The reception, clinic, ER and IW all have their separate waiting areas and wait-lists, and serve patients on a FCFS basis.\n"
